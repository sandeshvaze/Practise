Over the past few years, I’ve actually made the intentional move away from following primarily food blogs (which too often send me into that old comparison/jealousy/insecurity spiral, meh) and now find myself following bloggers in totally different niches — and it has been awesome.  I have blog categories on Feedly for photographers I admire, cool people working for social justice, interesting perspectives on faith, DIY stuff I actually want to try, you name it!  Mostly they’re just blogs that have nada to do with recipes, and I find that I look forward to reading them more than ever.  But that said, the blogs in my reader that get the most clicks by a landslide are in my favorite category that I have oh-so-creatively named — get ready for it — “fun”.
